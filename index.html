        <h1>Luna was a beloved cat, born on June 6, 2024, and sadly passed away on October 7, 2024, at just four months old. Raised by her human mother, Ivy, Luna was a deeply introverted cat who trusted only her human parents. Despite her short life, Luna's gentle and reserved nature left a lasting impression, making her a cherished member of the family.</h1>
